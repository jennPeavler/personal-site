        <p>I had been a chemical engineer for 12 years.  I was working at an R & D company.  My job was to design an industrial chemical plant that turned cornstalks into a chemical that resembled in appearance, table salt.</p>
        <p>•</p>
        <p>In December of 2016, after my fifth year working for the company, some investment stragegies proved not so wise after all, and the company went belly up.</p>
        <p>•</p>
        <p>Finding myself without employment, a challenging routine and knowing that I had to begin my search for livlihood, I began to reflect upon my years as a chemcial engineer.  As my reflections came to the surface of my mind, it occurred to me that the times that I was the most passionate and engaged throughout my career were the times that I was involved in programming computers.</p>
        <p>•</p>
        <p>At this point of realization, I changed out of my reflecting clothes, put down my thoughts, picked up my computer and enrolled at Turing School of Software and Design to become a front end engineer.  I began school late January of 2017.  Below you will find some projects that have resulted from my studies.</p>
